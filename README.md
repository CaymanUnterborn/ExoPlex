# ExoPlex

ExoPlex is a thermodynamically self-consistent mass-radius-composition calculator. Users input a bulk molar composition and a mass or radius, and ExoPlex will calculate the resulting radius or mass. Additionally it will produce the planet's core mass fraction, interior mineralogy and the pressure, adiabatic temperature, gravity and density profiles as a function of depth. 

ExoPlex is python 3 based and requires the following packages:  
numpy  
scipy  
matplotlib  
pexpect  
sympy  
jupyter (for Tutorial)  

Each of these can be installed using pip.

Currently ExoPlex is known to work on Mac and Linux machines.

Tutorials are available within the Tutorial folder which were created for the 2019 Sagan Workshop, and updated in 2022. Each word doc within the Tutorial folder examines individual available paramters utilized in the ExoPlex code. Once you get a handle on what the code can do, basic input files (example_by_mass.py or example_by_radius.py) are availabe in the Examples folder.

Expanded documentation for individual functions is forthcoming.
