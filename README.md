# ExoPlex

ExoPlex is a thermodynamically self-consistent mass-radius-composition calculator. Users input a bulk molar composition and a mass or radius, and ExoPlex will calculate the resulting radius or mass. Additionally it will produce the planet's core mass fraction, interior mineralogy and the pressure, adiabatic temperature, gravity and density profiles as a function of depth. 


ExoPlex is python 3 based and requires the following packages:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
pexpect
sympy

Each of these can be installed using pip.

Currently ExoPlex is known to work on Mac and Linux machines.

Tutorials are available within the examples folder. More documentation on the tutorials is coming soon, however, example_by_mass.py or example_by_radius.py will provide you with everything you need to begin building planets. 

Expanded documentation is forthcoming.
